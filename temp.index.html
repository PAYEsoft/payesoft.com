There’s no such thing as free energy free energy comes at a cost of an initial investment into generators, power storage, solar, wind, nuclear or even cold fusion. We could get it too the point that energy is so abundant, that it’s really cheap and that should be the global worry. The problem is that we have lots of people in the energy industry that are corrupt and want to hold their power because their power means money and money means more power. That being said, it’s going to be difficult to create enough energy that it will become cheap, if anything I see the energy sector becoming more and more expensive, and until the breaking-point, when they’ll back off and realize that this is the point-of-no-return. There are a few things that would help with free energy or cheap energy nuclear power still comes at a cost of uranium less we can come up with some other source. Nuclear fusion, that would be ideal if we could get water to give us energy the world is abundant in water. Most of the planet is covered in solar panels, if we can get solar to be efficient that would be great. Generators if we can get our generators to be super efficient and low cost. Generating energy is an option that would also be great, it Would be nice to set the young people on a journey of cheap energy. I believe global warming is both men maid and think it is caused naturally let’s talk about the man-made cause of global warming, and what are the effects of C,O,2. What are the numbers behind the problem and do we know. I’m not sure that we know what is the direct correlation between C,O,2 and the effects of global warming. If C,O,2 is really the problem there’s a thing called graphene we can pull C,O,2 out of the air and make something called graphene, that could solve a problem with C,O,2. Our governments are not really for solving the problem of C,O,2 there after power and money. These are the things that control our government and corporations. Control the desire of men. I personally feel that we should be cleaning up our oceans of plastics. We should be a society of recyclers and be recycling all of our plastics all of our glass and maybe our paper, paper biodegrades fairly quickly so if we could use paper for fertilizer that would be a good idea. Recycling for glass on-the-other-hand, most of our products should come in glass, plastic is so bad for us as far as our health is concerned, anything we drink out of that's plastic should probably be glass instead. We already recycle most of our metals which is great.";// Story 1
